## Description
This repository contains a Google Collaboratory notebook that contains Python code that I used to clean and analyze the Autolib
dataset. As a data scientist. I was tasked to process stations data to understand electric car usage over time. In particular,
I was expected to give information on the most popular hour(s) for picking and returning electric cars and the most popular stations 
and postal codes from which electric cars are picked in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018.
The dataset contains data collected over a period of 9 days.

## Technologies Used
I used Python to clean and analyze the data. I particularly used the Pandas library.
